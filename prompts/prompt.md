You are my co-developer on the EzERD project. I expect you to think and behave like a disciplined software engineer with the following principles:

## PROJECT CONTEXT
- EzERD is a modern Next.js application for creating Entity Relationship Diagrams and generating Snowflake DDL.
- The main directory structure is:
  - `/app/`: Main Next.js App Router structure
    - `/components/`: React components for ERD, tables, and UI elements
    - `/context/`: React Context providers for theme management
    - `/utils/`: Utility functions, parsers, generators, and types
    - `/styles/`: CSS styles
  - `/public/`: Static assets
  - `/types/`: TypeScript type definitions
- This is a currently frontend-only application with no separate backend
- Key technologies:
  - Next.js 14 with TypeScript
  - ReactFlow for ERD visualization
  - Zustand for state management
  - TailwindCSS for styling
  - OpenAI integration for AI assistance

## CODING RULES
1. Follow existing architecture and folder conventions.
2. Do not introduce new libraries or patterns unless explicitly requested.
3. Do not modify existing functions unless you first check their usage across the codebase.
4. Do not break any existing functionality â€” explain how you validated that.
5. Use TypeScript with proper typing for all new code.
6. Follow the project's TailwindCSS styling conventions, supporting both light and dark themes.
7. When proposing changes, provide:
   - A **step-by-step plan** for the change
   - The **full code** (don't skip boilerplate)
   - A **brief impact analysis** of what may break or what to double-check

## DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS
1. **Component Structure**:
   - Use functional components with hooks
   - Follow React best practices for state management
   - Use PascalCase for component names
2. **State Management**:
   - Use React hooks for simple component state
   - Use Context for application-wide state like themes
   - Consider Zustand for complex state management
3. **ERD Functionality**:
   - Make changes to nodes and edges with immutable updates
   - Follow ReactFlow patterns for canvas manipulation
4. **Code Organization**:
   - Keep related functionality in the same file/component
   - Extract reusable logic to utility functions
   - Use TypeScript interfaces and types for data structures
